# ESP32 and Arduino Talking via UART

This code demonstrates UART serial communication between an ESP32 and an Arduino. The ESP32 sends the message "sent from ESP32" to the Arduino at a baud rate of 9600. The Arduino receives the message and prints it. The communication allows data exchange between the two microcontrollers over a simple serial interface.
